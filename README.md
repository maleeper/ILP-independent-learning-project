## Dataset Content
 The "Online Retail Transaction" dataset contains information on transactions made by customers through an online retail platform. The dataset includes data on the products that were purchased, the quantity of each product, the date and time of each transaction, the price of each product, the unique identifier for each customer who made a purchase, and the country where each customer is located. This dataset can be used to analyze customer behavior and preferences, identify popular products, and optimize pricing and marketing strategies. The dataset is well-suited for data analysis and machine learning applications, as it contains a large volume of transactional data that can be used to train predictive models and make data-driven decisions.


__Column Descriptors__
| Column Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| StockCode | A code used to identify the product that was purchased |
| Description | A brief description of the product that was purchased |
| Quantity | The quantity of the product that was purchased |
| InvoiceDate | The date and time that the purchase was made |
| UnitPrice | The price of one unit of the product that was purchased |
| CustomerID | The unique identifier for the customer who made the purchase |
| Country | The country where the customer who made the purchase is located |

## Hypothesis and how to validate?
* List here your project hypothesis(es) and how you envision validating it (them) 
* Sales may be seasonal and impacted by events such as holidays.
* Day of the week may have a pattern.
* Suspect that the time of purchase corresponds the the country buying i.e. not so much in the early hours
* - assuming times are standard e.g. UTC and not local times
* some -ve sales i.e. returns or cancellations. Which are the products being returned?
* does %Return vary by country eg are Americans more likely to return goods?
* are there prices changes for items? If so what happens to the sales?
* we need to create 'Sales' = Quantity * UnitPrice and add this to the dataset
* if 'Sales' < 0 then 'Returns' = -1*'Sales' and 'Sales' = 0


## Project Plan
* Outline the high-level steps taken for the analysis.
* How was the data managed throughout the collection, processing, analysis and interpretation steps?
* Why did you choose the research methodologies you used?

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations
* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualisations

## Analysis techniques used
* List the data analysis methods used and explain limitations or alternative approaches.
* How did you structure the data analysis techniques. Justify your response.
* Did the data limit you, and did you use an alternative approach to meet these challenges?
* How did you use generative AI tools to help with ideation, design thinking and code optimisation?

## Ethical considerations
* Were there any data privacy, bias or fairness issues with the data?
* How did you overcome any legal or societal issues?

## Unfixed Bugs
* Please mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation are not valid reasons to leave bugs unfixed.
* Did you recognise gaps in your knowledge, and how did you address them?
* If applicable, include evidence of feedback received (from peers or instructors) and how it improved your approach or understanding.

## Development Roadmap
* What challenges did you face, and what strategies were used to overcome these challenges?
* What new skills or tools do you plan to learn next based on your project experience? 


## Main Data Analysis Libraries
* Here you should list the libraries you used in the project and provide an example(s) of how you used these libraries.


## Credits 

* In this section, you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 
* You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
